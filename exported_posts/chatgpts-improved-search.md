A few days ago I [wrote](https://samek.fyi/perplexity-better-at-quick-searches/) that Perplexity is better for quick searches. That may have changed. 

OpenAI announced some search improvements, though sources were not among them, and Sam Altman [mentioned](https://x.com/sama/status/1916625892123742290) improvements to the model. ChatGPT [now does a better job](https://chatgpt.com/share/680fe920-5014-800f-9a5e-04d54eacee28) at my example query, explicitly noting that the two models have different behavior.

I'm curious if this will be reflected on [Search Arena](https://beta.lmarena.ai/leaderboard/search).
