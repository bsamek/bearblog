Google released an impressive improvement to Gemini, which now tops the [WebDev Arena Leaderboard](https://web.lmarena.ai/leaderboard). That position had been held by Claude for quite a while.

Here's a Pareto frontier for the [Aider polyglot coding leaderboard](https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/). The analysis of March's Gemini [didn't include](https://aider.chat/2025/05/07/gemini-cost.html) reasoning tokens in the cost. They fixed the problem for May's release.

It's too bad it doesn't include o4-mini (medium), especially because the new Gemini sits right between o4-mini (high) and o3-plus-GPT-4.1. It's nice to see that the corrected pricing makes the Pareto frontier make sense again. Gemini 2.5 Pro wasn't some wild outlier.

I excluded some legacy models to reduce clutter, as well as GPT-4.1 nano, which did poorly enough to make its inclusion on the graph not useful.
