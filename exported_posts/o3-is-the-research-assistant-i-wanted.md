Deep Research (three separate products! from Perplexity, OpenAI, and Gemini) is usually more than I want. Instead I want something that stops when it has the answer. Here's a [great example](https://chatgpt.com/share/680ba0f9-c7e0-800f-b4b4-165e375cb8c7) about predicting the next pope. It searched the web to find out what prediction markets said, aggregated and normalized the data, and gave me a chart of probabilities. Then it made a second chart introducing me to each candidate.
