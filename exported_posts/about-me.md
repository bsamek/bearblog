I'm Brian Samek.

I began my career as a sysadmin in public and university libraries. I’ve been at MongoDB for nearly a decade, as Software Engineer, Lead, Director, and now Staff Engineer. I’ve helped scale our Continuous Integration system to handle hundreds of millions of tests a day, led a major software supply chain security initiative, and built teams that consistently delivered useful and reliable software.

I care about elegant tooling, digital privacy, and tech that empowers people. Here, I write about AI, digital tools, and things that sit at the intersection of people who write code and people who use it.

I live in Brooklyn with my partner Rakhel and pup Sila.
