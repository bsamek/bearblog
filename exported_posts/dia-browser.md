I tried [Dia](https://www.diabrowser.com/), a new Chromium-based browser with built-in AI features from the creators of [Arc](https://arc.net/). It has an AI chat sidebar that can reference any open tab, plus writing assistance that pulls context from multiple tabs. Their YouTube video shows someone writing an email in Gmail based on their Google Calendar tab.

It's a UX improvement over existing options. Brave's Leo only works with the current tab and requires your own API key for the models I want to use. Firefox awkwardly opens ChatGPT or Claude's actual UI and copy-pastes content. Chrome's Gemini Flash integration is clean but single-tab only.

I wish Dia kept more of what works well in Chrome. I noticed it's missing tab groups, which is a feature I use a lot.

Since Dia processes your tab contents for AI features, there are privacy concerns about where that data goes. You also can't pick your own models. I only saw it use GPT-4.1.

It reminds me of search engines before Google, trying Metacrawler and HotBot when no single option was clearly best. And it's hard to imagine Dia can compete with Google if they do a good job integrating AI into Chrome. I'd love to be wrong though, and see some new upstart do a great job with AI UX.
